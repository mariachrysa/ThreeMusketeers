This program implements the game three Musketeers by creating a board and reading the inputs from a file of the user\textquotesingle{}s choice. Once the game starts the user is asked to insert their move starting off by the three Musketeers. The game continuous until there is a winner, either by the enemies/\+Cardinal Richelieu\textquotesingle{}s men, or the three Musketeers. The game can be interrupted manually but the board always gets saved in another file, in case the user wants to restart the same game next time.
